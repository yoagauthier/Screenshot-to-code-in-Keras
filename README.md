# Turning design mockups into code with deep learning
Student project @CentraleSupelec for DeepLearning & Computer Vision courses.

## Using
For each dataset of templates, the complete Jupyter Notebook is inside each folder details the code and explanaitions.
Subfolders :
- html : contains the HTML files for the training
- images : contains the png or jpg screenshots for the training
- test : contains one screenshot of the training set and one from the test set (in order to compare the performances and detect overfitting).

To seen the html files fully rendered (including design), you will need to put them in the `Resources_for_the_index_file` folder (which contains css and js files).
The file `results.html` shows one example of generated code for each dataset.
